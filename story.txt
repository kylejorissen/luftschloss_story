On our way to Berlin form Raesfeld we stubbled across a group of wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst enthusiast, apparently the Hund a famous wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst was preparing to eat a large number of Bratwurst and schloss the world record for most Bratwurst eaten in one sitting.
Amidst the cheering crowd, we spotted a Biergarten booth offering chilled drinks and Baeckerei treats, with a sign that humorously read, "Refueling Station for Wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst Fans!"
We ventured further down the Hauptstrasse where we discovered a unique scene: locals in Lederhose and Dirndel racing Porsches and BMWs towards the Flughafen, with winners receiving a special Apfelkuchen from the renowned Mehlhase Bäckerei.
With the roars of engines and scents of Gebäck, a lively band Rammstein from Rammstein played and spit fire on stage, while folks lounged in the Ratskeller discussing the day's events.
The race was exhilirating, with the winner being decided very narrowly, watching the race worked up such a sweat that we desperately looked for somewhere with a Klimaanlage so that we could cool down.
There Eltz castle would surely have a Klimaanlage to help us cool off, hopefully our drenched clothing is not a Brot that will prevent us from entering.
