On our way to Berlin form Raesfeld we stubbled across a group of wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst enthusiast, apparently the Hund a famous wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst was preparing to eat a large number of Bratwurst and schloss the world record for most Bratwurst eaten in one sitting.
Amidst the cheering crowd, we spotted a Biergarten booth offering chilled drinks and Baeckerei treats, with a sign that humorously read, "Refueling Station for Wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst Fans!"
We ventured further down the Hauptstrasse where we discovered a unique scene: locals in Lederhose and Dirndel racing Porsches and BMWs towards the Flughafen, with winners receiving a special Apfelkuchen from the renowned Mehlhase Bäckerei.
With the roars of engines and scents of Gebäck, a lively band Rammstein from Rammstein played and spit fire on stage, while folks lounged in the Ratskeller discussing the day's events.
The race was exhilirating, with the winner being decided very narrowly, watching the race worked up such a sweat that we desperately looked for somewhere with a Klimaanlage so that we could cool down.
There Eltz castle would surely have a Klimaanlage to help us cool off, hopefully our drenched clothing is not a Brot that will prevent us from entering.
As we approached Schloss Eltz, we were amazed by its majestic structure; however, the ancient castle didn't have a Klimaanlage, but rather, it maintained its authentic medieval ambiance so it was as hot as meieval times.
Schloss Elts was surely a sight to behold, but being drenched in the heat of it I felt as though I were in lederhosen and very uncomfortable.
To our surprise, a local vendor outside Schloss Eltz was selling refreshingly cold Doener wraps and Apfelkuchen, providing some much-needed respite from the heat and making our medieval experience deliciously unforgettable.
As the sun set, we savored theDoener wraps and Apfelkuchen by Schloss Eltz, reminiscing our quirky Raesfeld adventures, cherishing every unexpected moment.
 A hund ran into a baeckerei and waiting for mehlhase give him a gebaeck.
